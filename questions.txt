Q1: Why didnâ€™t we use sudo before node lab.js in this case?
 We used node because we are just running the file  while sudo is more 
for installing something or either using specific ports or 
just some other thing that requires more attention too.

Q2: What does lab.js do?
lab.js just shows async file reading in Node.js

Q3: Why does *************after readFile*****************
appear before the contents of plain.txt in the output while the call to readFile is before
the console.log call that prints this line.
Because the file is async. the node starts the file read 
and then it immediately continues to the next line of code
